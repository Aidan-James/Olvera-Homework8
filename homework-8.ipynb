    "Previously, we studied the [Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model), a simple model from statistical physics. The Ising model was originally applied to study ferromagnetism, but it has since been generalized and applied to understand a wide variety of physical and biological phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our work on the Ising model, we wanted to understand how changing the parameters of the model affects behavior. In this homework problem, we will consider going in the opposite direction: given that we observe the behavior of an Ising system, how can we infer its parameters? In general, this kind of problem is called an [inverse problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_problem). This problem specifically is referred to as the inverse Ising problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inverse problems are very common in practical contexts, but they are also of great theoretical interest. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_the_shape_of_a_drum) for a provocative example of a physics-inspired inverse problem."
